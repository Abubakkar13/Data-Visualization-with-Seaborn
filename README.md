## 1. Introduction to Seaborn

Seaborn is a data visualization library in Python. It is used to produce statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of Matplotlib. It also supports NumPy and Pandas data structures. It also supports statistical units from SciPy.


In the world of analytics, data visualization plays an important role to explore and understand the data. Seaborn is developed to make this process of exploring and understanding the data smooth. It provides a high-level interface to produce high quality statistical graphics. The customizability and backend options for Matplotlib makes it easy to generate publication-quality figures.
