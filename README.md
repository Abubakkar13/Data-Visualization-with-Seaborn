# Data Visualization with Seaborn Project

The subject of this project is Seaborn. It is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. 

The contents of this project is divided into various sections which are listed below:-

## 1. Introduction to Seaborn

Seaborn is a data visualization library in Python. It is used to produce statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of Matplotlib. It also supports NumPy and Pandas data structures. It also supports statistical units from SciPy.


In the world of analytics, data visualization plays an important role to explore and understand the data. Seaborn is developed to make this process of exploring and understanding the data smooth. It provides a high-level interface to produce high quality statistical graphics. The customizability and backend options for Matplotlib makes it easy to generate publication-quality figures.



## 2. Comparison of Seaborn and Matplotlib

Seaborn uses Matplotlib to draw plots. Many actions can be accomplished with only Seaborn functions. Further customization options might require using Matplotlib directly. Seaborn is not an alternative to Matplotlib. We can think of it as a complement to Matplotlib. As it is built on top of Matplotlib, we can call Matplotlib functions directly for creating simple plots.

It is summarized that – 

“If Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible, Seaborn tries to make a well-defined set of hard things easy too in a well-defined way.” 

Seaborn helps to resolve two major problems faced by Matplotlib. The problems are:-

1.	Working with Matplotlib’s default parameters

2.	Working with data frames
